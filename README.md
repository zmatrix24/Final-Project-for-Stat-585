==========================
A glimpse of the development of IT companies
========================================================

#### Topic
Google, Apple, Yahoo, IBM, Facebook, Twitter, AT&T... this list can go longer and longer. Yes, they are all IT companies and they represent new trends, science and technology.

Some of them are new, else are old. Some of them are developing and some seem "expired".
And a lot of them were once on top of the tides. So let us take a look at the stock price of all those companies and make comparison among them and try to summarise some conclusions.

#### Questions of Interest
1. How do the stock prices reflect the development of the company?
2. How do the stock prices reflect the development of the whole market through those representative companies?
3. What happened to those "expired" companies?
4. Any historical moments corresponding to big changes in the stock prices?

#### Motivation

I am interested in the development of those IT companies. And the development is reflected through the price of their stocks. So I would like to use what I have learned to dig for something. It would be interesting.

#### Which Data
Right now, I am thinking about data from Google Finance
